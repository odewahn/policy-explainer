Sure, let's break down the O'Reilly AI Use Policy in simple terms. This policy is all about how employees should use AI tools to
create and manage educational content. Here’s what you need to know:

### 1. Authorized Use

**What You Can Use:**

- O'Reilly has a list of approved AI tools (called "GenAI Models") and specific tasks you can use them for. This list is in a
  section called "Exhibit A."
- If you find a new AI tool or think of a new way to use an approved tool, you can suggest it by emailing
  ai-questions@oreilly.com.

**General Rules:**

- Always use good judgment when using AI tools, even if they are approved.
- This policy applies to both free and paid AI tools.

### 2. Inputs

**What Are Inputs?**

- Inputs are anything you put into an AI tool, like text, images, code, etc.

**Review Terms:**

- Check the legal terms of the AI tool to understand how your inputs will be used. Some tools might use your inputs to improve
  their models, while others might not.

**Guidelines for Inputs:**

- **Trade Secrets:** Don’t input any secret or sensitive information.
- **Third-Party IP:** Don’t input anything protected by someone else’s intellectual property rights unless O'Reilly owns it or
  has permission.
- **Confidential Info:** Don’t input confidential information from third parties.
- **Personal Info:** Don’t input personal information like names, addresses, or financial details unless you have explicit
  permission.
- **Objectionable Content:** Avoid inputting anything offensive, controversial, or inappropriate.
- **Use Judgment:** If you’re unsure about inputting something, ask the legal team at ai-questions@oreilly.com.

### 3. Outputs

**What Are Outputs?**

- Outputs are what the AI tool generates, like text, images, or code.

**Ownership:**

- Make sure you understand the legal terms about who owns the output. Generally, you should own the output, but be aware that
  some outputs might not be protected by copyright.

**Guidelines for Outputs:**

- **Text Outputs:**
  - Enhance and customize AI-generated text with your own style.
  - Use AI for short text snippets like headlines or social media posts.
  - Use AI to enhance course content but don’t copy it verbatim.
  - Always fact-check and verify the accuracy of AI-generated text.
- **Image/Video Outputs:**
  - Use AI to create generic figures or illustrations but modify them to add originality.
  - Enhance the quality of videos or audio files using AI tools.
  - Avoid copying distinctive features of AI-generated images or videos.
- **Software Code Outputs:**
  - Some AI tools that generate code offer legal protection against copyright claims if you follow certain rules.
  - Modify AI-generated code to add human authorship.
  - Use best practices like filtering out duplicate code and documenting AI-generated code.

**General Guidelines:**

- **Tracking:** Keep track of what parts of your work were created by you and what parts were created by AI.
- **Attribution:** Some AI tools require you to give credit if you use their output. Check with the legal team before publishing
  any attribution.
- **Requesting New Tools:** Inform internal reviewers if a new tool uses AI technology.
- **Use Judgment:** Always use good judgment when incorporating AI outputs into your work. If unsure, ask the legal team.

### 4. Special Considerations for Open Source AI Models

**General:**

- Some open-source AI tools can’t be used for commercial purposes, which might include your work at O'Reilly.
- The output from these tools might have legal obligations that could affect O'Reilly’s proprietary software.

**Guidelines:**

- Consult with the legal team before using open-source AI tools.
- Ensure your use of these tools follows the policy guidelines.
