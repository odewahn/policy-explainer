Welcome! Today, we're going to talk about O'Reilly's AI Use Policy for Employees. This policy is designed to help us harness the power of generative AI technologies while mitigating risks like data security vulnerabilities, privacy concerns, and intellectual property issues. It's important to follow these guidelines to ensure we're using AI responsibly and effectively. Now, let's dive into some specific questions you might have.

# LAYPERSON

Great, thanks for the overview. So, what kinds of documents can I upload to these AI models?

# LAWYER

Good question. When it comes to uploading documents, there are several key points to keep in mind. First, do not upload any trade secrets or sensitive information. For example, avoid submitting proprietary algorithms or unique pedagogical approaches. Second, don't upload materials protected by third-party intellectual property rights unless O'Reilly owns them or has the proper license. This includes things like entire chapters of copyrighted books. Third, steer clear of uploading any personal information, like
contact details or social security numbers, unless you have explicit authorization from the Legal team. And finally, avoid any content that could be considered obscene, hateful, or politically charged.

# LAYPERSON

Got it. What about the outputs generated by these AI models? Can I use them as-is?

# LAWYER

That's another important area. Generally, you should not copy and paste the output verbatim. Instead, enhance and customize it with your own voice and style. For example, if you're using AI to generate assessment questions, make sure to add your unique touch to make the content engaging and relevant. Also, be cautious with image or video outputs. Modify them meaningfully before incorporating them into your work. And for software code, make sure to follow best practices like using filtering options and
documenting any modifications you make.

# LAYPERSON

Interesting. Are there any specific guidelines for using open-source AI models?

# LAWYER

Yes, there are. Open-source AI models often come with licenses that may restrict commercial use. Before using any open-source AI model, consult with the Legal team to understand the terms. Also, ensure that your use of inputs and outputs from these models aligns with the overall guidelines of the policy. This is crucial because some open-source licenses can impose obligations on O'Reilly to make certain source code publicly available, which we want to avoid.

# LAYPERSON

What should I do if I notice any bias or performance issues in the AI outputs?

# LAWYER

If you notice any bias or performance issues, it's important to address them immediately. First, verify the accuracy of any factual statements in the output. Don't rely solely on the AI; cross-check with reliable sources. Second, check for detectable bias, especially in images or descriptions of people. Bias can manifest in various forms, like gender or racial bias. If you find consistent issues, report them to O'Reilly at the provided email address. This helps us improve the AI models and ensure fair and inclusive outcomes.

# LAYPERSON

Thanks for the detailed answers. Is there anything else I should keep in mind?

# LAWYER

Absolutely. Always exercise good judgment when using AI models. If you're ever unsure about whether to submit certain inputs or use specific outputs, don't hesitate to contact the Legal team. Also, keep track of which parts of your work were created by you and which were generated by AI. And remember, some AI models require attribution if you use their outputs publicly, so always check with the Legal team before publishing any attributions.

# LAYPERSON

This has been really helpful. Thanks for clarifying everything!

You're welcome! Just remember to review the policy periodically, as it may be updated to reflect new advancements in AI technology and changes in legal frameworks. If you have any more questions, feel free to reach out to the Legal team.
