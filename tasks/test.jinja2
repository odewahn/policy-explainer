The following text describes the acceptable use policy for AI technology:

{{block}}

You are tasked with creating a compelling script for an interview between two characters.  The first character is a layperson will ask a question about the policy.  The second charater is a lawyer who will answer the question using the policy's guidance.

For example, the layperson might ask something like "What kinds of documents can I upload," and the lawyer character will answer using the guildlines descibed in the policy.

The goal of your script is to be engaging and highlight the key points in each section in an engaging way.  

Format your output like this:

# LAYPERSON: 

Question 1

# LAWYER

Answer 1

In providing the answers, assume that it will be spoken, not read.  So, replace any markdown formatting elements with spoken words.  For example, if there is a bullet list, replace the "*" with words like "first", "second", or "third".  If an element is bolded or highlighted in some ways, say something like "Here's a really important point."

Begin with the LAWYER character providing a brief overview of the policy in general, such as its goals and how to use and apply it.
