Welcome! Today, we're going to talk about O'Reilly's AI Use Policy for Employees. This policy is designed to help us harness the
power of generative AI technologies while mitigating risks like data security vulnerabilities, privacy concerns, and intellectual
property issues. It's important to follow these guidelines to ensure we're using AI responsibly and effectively. Now, let's dive
into some specific questions you might have.

# LAYPERSON

What kinds of documents can I upload to a GenAI Model?

# LAWYER

Great question! When it comes to uploading documents, there are several key guidelines to follow. First, do not submit any input
containing trade secrets or other sensitive or strategic information. For example, avoid uploading proprietary algorithms or
unique pedagogical approaches. Second, do not submit materials protected by third-party intellectual property rights unless
O'Reilly owns them or has the proper license. This includes text, images, audio, or video. Third, do not upload any third-party
confidential information or personally identifiable information, like contact info or social security numbers, unless expressly
authorized by our Legal team. Lastly, avoid submitting any materials that could be considered obscene, hateful, immoral,
offensive, controversial, or politically charged.

What should I do if I want to use a new GenAI Model that's not on the approved list?

# LAWYER

If you want to explore a new GenAI Model that's not on our approved list, you can submit it for approval. Just send an email to
ai-questions@oreilly.com with the details. While you're waiting for approval, make sure to follow the general guidelines in our
policy and exercise reasonable judgment. Remember, this policy applies to both free and paid GenAI Models.

# LAYPERSON

How should I handle the outputs generated by a GenAI Model?

# LAWYER

Handling outputs is crucial. First, make sure you own the intellectual property rights to the output. Even if you do, be aware
that most outputs based solely on a prompt are not eligible for copyright protection and may be considered public domain. When
incorporating outputs into your work, enhance and customize them with your own voice and style. For example, if you're using AI
to generate assessment questions, add your unique touch to make them engaging and relevant. Avoid copying and pasting outputs
verbatim; aim to use no more than 10% of the unmodified output in your final product. For images and videos, make meaningful
alterations to ensure originality. For software code, consider if ownership is important and make necessary modifications to
ensure human authorship.

# LAYPERSON

What should I do if I notice biased or inaccurate outputs?

# LAWYER

If you notice biased or inaccurate outputs, it's essential to take action. First, verify the accuracy and completeness of any
factual statements. Don't rely solely on the output; cross-check with reliable sources. If the output depicts an image or
describes a group of people, check for detectable bias and make adjustments to ensure fairness and inclusivity. Be aware of
various types of bias, like anchoring bias, sampling bias, and confirmation bias. If you consistently see biased content or poor
performance, report it to ai-questions@oreilly.com.

# LAYPERSON

Are there any special considerations for using open-source GenAI Models?

# LAWYER

Yes, there are special considerations for open-source GenAI Models. Some of these models are governed by licenses that prohibit
commercial use, which means you might not be able to use them for your work at O'Reilly. Additionally, the output from these
models may be subject to copyleft or network viral open-source licenses, which could impose obligations on O'Reilly to make
certain source code publicly available. Always consult with our Legal team in advance to understand the terms and ensure your
usage conforms to our policy guidelines.
