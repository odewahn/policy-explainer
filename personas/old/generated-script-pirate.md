Ahoy there, matey! Gather 'round and let me spin ye a yarn about O'Reilly's AI Use Policy. This here policy be our compass, guidin' us through the treacherous waters of generative AI technology. The goal be to harness the power of these AI tools while avoidin' the perils like factually untrue outputs, biased content, and breaches of data security. We want to use these tools wisely to create and curate educational content without riskin' our ship's integrity or infringin' on others' intellectual property. Now, let's set sail and dive into the details, shall we?

# LAYPERSON

What kinds of documents can I upload to these AI tools?

# LAWYER

Arrr, a fine question, matey! When it comes to what ye can upload, or as we call it, "Input," ye need to be cautious. First, don't be uploadin' any trade secrets or sensitive information. For example, avoid sharin' unique algorithms or entire portions of our books. Second, steer clear of materials protected by third-party intellectual property rights unless O'Reilly owns 'em or has the proper licenses. Third, don't be uploadin' any third party's confidential information or any personal information like contact details or social security numbers. And lastly, avoid any content that be obscene, hateful, or ontroversial. If ye be unsure, always use yer best judgment or consult the legal team.

# LAYPERSON

What should I do with the outputs generated by these AI tools?

# LAWYER

Ah, the outputs, or what we call "Output," be another treasure chest to handle with care. First, make sure ye own the rights to the output. Even if ye do, remember that most outputs based solely on a prompt might not be eligible for copyright protection, makin' them free for anyone to use. Enhance and customize the output with yer own voice and style. For text, use it for short excerpts and always verify facts. For images or videos, modify them meaningfully before usin' them. And for software code, follow best practices like usin' filters and documentin' any modifications. Always track and document which parts were created by ye and which by the AI, and consult the legal team if ye be unsure.

# LAYPERSON

Can I use open source AI models for my work?

# LAWYER

Arrr, open source AI models, or OSS GenAI Models, be a tricky sea to navigate. Some of these models come with licenses that prohibit commercial use, which means ye might not be able to use 'em for O'Reilly's work. The output from these models might also be subject to copyleft licenses, which could force us to make our source code public. Always consult with the legal team before usin' any OSS GenAI Models and make sure yer usage conforms to the guidelines in the policy. If possible, download the model to yer own ship, I mean, system, to avoid these issues.

# LAYPERSON

What about performance and bias issues in the outputs?

# LAWYER

Ah, ye be wise to ask about that. When it comes to performance and bias, always verify the accuracy of any factual statements in the output. Don't rely solely on the AI; fact-check through reliable sources. Also, check for any detectable bias, like gender or racial bias, and mitigate it to ensure fair and inclusive outcomes. Be aware of other types of bias like anchoring bias, sampling bias, and confirmation bias. If ye notice consistent bias or poor performance, report it to O'Reilly. Always use yer best
judgment and consult the legal team if ye be unsure.

# LAYPERSON

What if I want to request a new AI tool or service?

# LAWYER

Arrr, if ye be wantin' to request a new tool or service, inform the internal reviewers about how the tool employs AI technology. Make sure it aligns with our policy and guidelines. Always exercise appropriate judgment when incorporatin' AI outputs into content for O'Reilly. If ye be unsure, consult the legal team at ai-questions@oreilly.com. And remember, matey, this policy be our map to safely navigate the AI seas, so keep it close and review it periodically.

# LAYPERSON
