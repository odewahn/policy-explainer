Hello everyone,

Today, we're going to talk about O'Reilly's AI Use Policy for Employees, last updated on October 24, 2023. This policy is designed to help us harness the power of generative AI technologies, or GenAI Models, while also mitigating the risks associated with their use. These models can create captivating text, diagrams, videos, audio effects, quizzes, and more with remarkable efficiency. However, we need to be cautious about potential issues like generating factually incorrect outputs, biased content, data security vulnerabilities, and intellectual property risks.

Let's dive into the key points of this policy.

First, let's talk about authorized use. You can find a list of O'Reilly-approved GenAI Models and their acceptable use cases in Exhibit A. We encourage you to explore other GenAI Models and new use cases, but make sure to submit them for approval at ai-questions at oreilly dot com. Always use reasonable judgment and comply with the guidelines in this policy, whether the GenAI Model is free or paid.

Next, let's discuss inputs. Inputs are the prompts, text, images, code, or any other materials you submit to a GenAI Model. It's crucial to review the GenAI Model's legal terms and conditions governing inputs. Some models may use your inputs to train their underlying model, while others may not. For example, using OpenAI's ChatGPT via an API does not allow OpenAI to use the inputs for training, but using the web UI does, unless you opt out.

Here are some guidelines for submitting inputs:

First, do not submit any input containing trade secrets or other sensitive information. For example, avoid submitting unique algorithms or entire portions of our books or course materials.

Second, do not submit materials protected by third-party intellectual property rights unless O'Reilly owns them or the applicable license permits it. For instance, submitting an entire chapter of a copyright-protected book could lead to legal liability.

Third, do not submit a third party's confidential information.

Fourth, do not submit any personal information, including personally identifiable information, unless expressly authorized by Legal. For example, if you want to use GenAI Models to record customer complaint calls, consider the privacy implications and contact ai-questions at oreilly dot com.

Fifth, do not submit any materials that may reasonably contain obscene, hateful, immoral, offensive, controversial, or politically charged terms or images.

Finally, always use your judgment. If you're unsure whether to submit certain inputs, contact ai-questions at oreilly dot com.

Now, let's move on to outputs. Outputs are the text, images, code, or other materials generated by GenAI Models. It's important to review the GenAI Model's legal terms and conditions governing outputs. Ensure that you own the intellectual property rights in the output. Even if you own the output, you may still infringe on others' rights. For example, the US Copyright Office has noted that most outputs solely based on a prompt are not eligible for copyright protection.

Here are some guidelines for incorporating outputs into content:

First, enhance and customize text outputs with your own voice and style. For example, when using GenAI Models to produce assessment questions, incorporate your distinctive voice and style.

Second, use GenAI Models for short excerpts of text, like headlines or social media posts.

Third, use GenAI Models to enhance course content, but do not copy the output verbatim. For example, use GenAI Models to develop analogies or interactive learning activities, but always add your own touch.

Fourth, do not copy and paste output verbatim. Aim to use no more than 10% of the unmodified output in your finished product.

For image or video outputs, use GenAI Models to generate generic figures and modify the outputs meaningfully. For example, make significant alterations to illustrations before incorporating them into your work.

For software code outputs, consider if it's important for O'Reilly to own the copyrights. If ownership is meaningful, enhance and modify the generated code. Follow best practices when using tools like Copilot, such as using the "Duplicate Detection" filter and including comments to identify AI-generated code.

In general, carefully track and document which parts of a work were created by a human author and which were created by a GenAI Model. Some GenAI Models require attribution, so do not publish any attribution without permission from ai-questions at oreilly dot com.

Lastly, let's address performance and bias issues for outputs. Verify the accuracy and completeness of factual statements and check for detectable bias in images or descriptions of people. Be aware of other types of bias, such as anchoring bias, sampling bias, and confirmation bias. If you notice consistent bias or poor performance in a GenAI Model, report it to ai-questions at oreilly dot com.

In conclusion, this policy is here to help us use GenAI Models effectively and responsibly. If you have any questions or need clarification, please reach out to O'Reilly's Legal team at ai-questions at oreilly dot com. Thank you for your attention and cooperation.
