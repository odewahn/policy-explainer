Today we're going to discuss O'Reilly's AI Use Policy for Employees, last updated on October 24, 2023. This policy is designed to help us harness the power of generative AI technologies, or GenAI Models, while mitigating the associated risks. These models can significantly enhance our ability to create and curate educational content, but we must use them responsibly to avoid issues like generating inaccurate or biased outputs, compromising data security, or infringing on intellectual property rights.

First, let's talk about authorized use. O'Reilly has a list of approved GenAI Models and corresponding use cases, which you can find in Exhibit A. You're encouraged to explore other models and new use cases, but always submit them for approval at ai-questions at o'reilly dot com. Remember, this policy applies to both free and paid GenAI Models.

Next, let's discuss inputs. Inputs are any prompts, text, images, code, or other materials you submit to a GenAI Model. It's crucial to review the GenAI Model's legal terms and conditions governing inputs. Some models may use your inputs to train their underlying models, while others offer options to restrict this usage. For example, using OpenAI's ChatGPT via an API does not allow OpenAI to use the inputs for training, but using the web UI does, unless you opt out.

Here are some guidelines for inputs:

First, do not submit any trade secrets or sensitive information. For instance, avoid submitting unique algorithms or entire portions of our books or course materials.

Second, do not submit materials protected by third-party intellectual property rights unless O'Reilly owns them or has the necessary permissions.

Third, do not submit a third party's confidential information.

Fourth, do not submit any personal information, including personally identifiable information, unless expressly authorized by Legal.

Fifth, do not submit any objectionable content, such as obscene, hateful, or politically charged materials.

Finally, always use your judgment. If you're unsure about submitting certain inputs, contact ai-questions at o'reilly dot com.

Now, let's move on to outputs. Outputs are the text, images, code, or other materials generated by GenAI Models. It's important to ensure that you own the intellectual property rights in the output. Even if you own the output, you may still infringe on others' rights. For example, the US Copyright Office has noted that most outputs solely based on a prompt are not eligible for copyright protection.

Here are some guidelines for outputs:

First, enhance and customize text outputs with your own voice and style. For example, when using GenAI Models to produce assessment questions, incorporate your distinctive voice and style.

Second, use GenAI Models for short excerpts of text, like headlines or social media posts.

Third, use GenAI Models to enhance course content, but do not copy the output verbatim. Aim to use no more than 10% of the unmodified output in your finished product.

Fourth, for image or video outputs, use GenAI Models to generate generic figures and modify the outputs meaningfully before incorporating them into your work.

Fifth, for software code outputs, consider if it's important for O'Reilly to own the copyrights. If so, enhance and modify the generated code to ensure human authorship.

In general, carefully track and document which parts of a work were created by a human author and which were created by a GenAI Model. Some GenAI Models require attribution, so do not publish any attribution without permission from ai-questions at o'reilly dot com.

Finally, let's address performance and bias issues for outputs. Verify the accuracy and completeness of any factual statements in the output. Check for detectable bias in images or descriptions of groups of people. Be aware of other types of bias, such as anchoring bias, sampling bias, and confirmation bias. If you notice consistent bias or poor performance in a GenAI Model, report it to ai-questions at o'reilly dot com.

Special considerations apply when using open-sourced GenAI Models. Some of these models are governed by licenses that prohibit commercial use, which may mean you cannot use them for O'Reilly's work. Always consult with Legal in advance regarding the terms of these models.

In summary, this policy is here to help us use GenAI Models effectively and responsibly. If you have any questions or need further guidance, please contact ai-questions at o'reilly dot com. Thank you for your attention and cooperation.
