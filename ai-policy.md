Hello everyone,

Today, we're going to talk about O'Reilly's AI Use Policy for Employees, last updated on October 24, 2023. This policy is designed to help us harness the power of generative AI technologies, or GenAI Models, while also mitigating the risks associated with their use. These models can generate text, diagrams, videos, audio effects, quizzes, and more, making our work more efficient and engaging. However, we need to be cautious about potential issues like generating inaccurate content, data security vulnerabilities, and intellectual property concerns.

Let's dive into the key points of this policy.

First, let's talk about **Authorized Use**. We have a list of O'Reilly-approved GenAI Models and their acceptable use cases. You can find this list in Exhibit A. While you're encouraged to explore new models and use cases, always submit them for approval. Remember, this policy applies to both free and paid GenAI Models.

Next, we have **Inputs**. Inputs are anything you submit to a GenAI Model, like prompts, text, images, or code. It's crucial to review the GenAI Model's legal terms regarding inputs. Some models might use your inputs to train their underlying models, while others might not. For example, using OpenAI’s ChatGPT via an API doesn't allow OpenAI to use your inputs for training, but using the web UI does, unless you opt out.

Here are some guidelines for inputs:

First, **do not submit trade secrets or sensitive information**. For instance, avoid submitting unique algorithms or entire portions of our books.

Second, **do not submit materials protected by third-party IP rights** unless O'Reilly owns them or has the right to submit them. For example, submitting a chapter of a copyrighted book could lead to legal issues.

Third, **do not submit third-party confidential information**.

Fourth, **do not submit personal information** like contact info or financial details unless authorized by Legal.

Fifth, **do not submit objectionable content**. This includes anything obscene, hateful, or politically charged.

Lastly, **use your judgment**. If you're unsure about submitting certain inputs, contact ai-questions@oreilly.com.

Now, let's move on to **Outputs**. Outputs are the materials generated by GenAI Models. It's important to understand the legal terms governing outputs. Generally, you should ensure that you own the IP rights in the output. However, even if you own the output, it might not be eligible for copyright protection and could be considered public domain.

Here are some guidelines for outputs:

First, **enhance and customize text outputs with your own voice and style**. For example, when creating assessment questions, make sure they reflect your unique voice.

Second, **use GenAI Models for short excerpts of text**. For instance, generating headlines or social media posts is generally acceptable.

Third, **use GenAI Models to enhance course content**. For example, developing analogies or interactive activities, but don't copy the output verbatim.

Fourth, **do not copy and paste output verbatim**. Aim to use no more than 10% of the unmodified output in your final product.

For image or video outputs:

First, **use GenAI Models to generate generic figures**.

Second, **modify the image or video outputs**. For example, make meaningful alterations to illustrations before using them.

Third, **use GenAI Models to enhance the quality of video or audio files**. For instance, using Adobe Podcast’s AI tools to improve audio quality.

Fourth, **do not copy distinctive features of the outputs**. Avoid using unique visual styles or character traits without permission.

For software code outputs:

First, **consider if it's important for O'Reilly to own the copyrights in the generated code**. If ownership is meaningful, enhance and modify the code to ensure human authorship.

Second, **ensure that the requirements to obtain indemnification are met**. This includes using filtering options and making minimal modifications to the generated code.

Third, **engage in best practices when using tools like Copilot**. This includes using duplicate detection filters, opting out of data collection, and documenting the use of GenAI Models.

Lastly, **do not use Copilot tools to develop source code files containing personal data or sensitive information**.

In general:

First, **carefully track and document which parts of a work were created by a human and which by a GenAI Model**.

Second, **do not publish any attribution without permission**.

Third, **inform internal reviewers about the use of AI technology in new tools or services**.

Fourth, **use your judgment when incorporating outputs into content**. If you're unsure, contact ai-questions@oreilly.com.

Finally, let's address performance and bias issues for outputs:

First, **verify the accuracy and completeness of factual statements**. Do not rely solely on the output; fact-check through reliable sources.

Second, **check for detectable bias in images or descriptions of people**. Ensure fair and inclusive outcomes.

Third, **be aware of other types of bias** like anchoring bias, sampling bias, and confirmation bias.

If you notice consistent bias or poor performance in a GenAI Model, report it to ai-questions@oreilly.com.

Lastly, let's discuss **Special Considerations in Using Open Sourced GenAI Models**. Some open-source models prohibit commercial use, which may mean you can't use them for O'Reilly's work. The output of these models might also be subject to copyleft licenses, imposing obligations on O'Reilly.

Here are some guidelines:

First, **consult with Legal regarding the terms of open-source models**.

Second, **ensure your usage conforms with the policy guidelines**.

Third, **if possible, download the open-source model to use locally**.

That's a comprehensive overview of our AI Use Policy. Remember, the goal is to leverage AI technology responsibly and effectively while safeguarding our data, intellectual property, and the integrity of our content.

Thank you for your attention and cooperation.
